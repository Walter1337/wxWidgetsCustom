Example of local .git/info/exclude file (like .gitignore but never
part of the repo), see
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/767147/ignore-the-gitignore-file-itself

This can be used when wxWidgets is not checked out (either as submodule, 
or the other way around: wxWidgets and the CMake build as submodule) 
but simply unpacked from a tarball. In this case you don't want to have
anything to do with the wxWidgets source tree (at least in early beta as
we are). <rant>Bonus points for not using the submodule feature.</rant>

Putting this in a .gitignore is problematic because 1) this would break
other wxWidgets/Cmake integration schemes (so .gitignore must not
be committed) but 2) having this .gitignore file floating around 
uncommitted is nasty because it breaks git tools (so .gitignore must
be committed).
