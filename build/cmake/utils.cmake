	#   version and update it only if needed (this will avoid triggering a complete rebuild
	#   if CMake runs again but nothing changes in the WXSETUP_XXX options)
	# - inject autoconf-like defines at the beginning of the file (e.g. HAVE_X, SIZEOF_Y, etc.)
	# - place port/platform-specific overrides at the end of the file
	# - copy the file in its final location
	# The generation itself is not 100% straightforward, because the wxUSE_XYZ options do not
	# appear as such here in CMake - they are prefixed with WXSETUP_ (everything configurable
	# in setup is, so it's the case for wxUSE_XYZ but also for WXWIN_XYZ defines). To be able

# Add precompiled headers to the current project. Needs a reference
# to the *name* of the variable holding the source files - not its
# value.
#
# There are 2 forms of invocation:
# 1) wx_set_pch(varname [prefix=pch])
# 2) wx_set_pch(varname pch_impl pch_header [pch_header_fullpath=pch_header])
# See their full description below. Form 1) should be used for regular projects
# where the pch .h/.cpp files are "private" to the project being compiled, and
# have the same prefix name (e.g. pch.h, pch.cpp).
# Form 2) should be used when the header file is public (or otherwise does not sit 
# next to the source file); this is the case for wxWidgets.
#
# Example (2nd form):
# set(LIB_SRC foo.cpp bar.cpp)
# wx_set_pch(LIB_SRC stdafx) # notice the absence of the expansion operator ${}: we pass the *name* of the variable
# add_library(mylib ${LIB_SRC}) # ${LIB_SRC} is now foo.cpp;bar.cpp;stdafx.h;stdafx.cpp
